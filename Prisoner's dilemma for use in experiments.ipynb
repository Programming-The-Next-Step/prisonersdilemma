    "> Imagine you are one of two people being questioned about the same crime. They are each talking to the interrogator separately. The interrogator gives each person the same deal: \n",
    "they can choose to vouch for the other person’s innocence (COOPERATING) or rat them out (DEFECTING). \n",
    "And of course, there’s a twist. If both people cooperate with each other, they’ll each get 3 months off their sentence, but if the first person vouches for the second person, and the second person rats them out, the first person will get no time off their sentence and the second person will get 5 months off their time. Lastly, if they both rat each other out, they each get 1 month off their time."
