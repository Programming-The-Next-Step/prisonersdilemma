    "Below you can find code for the single-trial prisoner's dilemma game with a specific add-on: participants play either with an ethnic in-group member, out-group member or have no information about their opponent. Opponents are programmed to use one of 7 strategies in each trial (consisting of 7 rounds as default): \n",
